# Real-Estat-Price-Predictor
Real Estate Price Prediction & Valuation System
Client Problem
Real estate businesses often struggle to price properties accurately due to: - Large variations in property size, type, and location - Inconsistent or incomplete historical data - Manual valuation processes that are slow and error‑prone
Incorrect pricing leads to lost deals, longer sales cycles, and reduced investor confidence.

My Solution
I built an end‑to‑end machine learning–based property valuation system that predicts house prices using structured real estate data and delivers results through an easy‑to‑use web interface.
The solution converts raw property data into reliable, data‑driven price estimates that can support agents, investors, and real estate platforms in faster decision‑making.

What I Built
A complete data preprocessing and feature engineering pipeline
Multiple regression models evaluated to ensure best accuracy
A finalized production‑ready model with optimized performance
A reusable prediction module for single‑property valuation
A Streamlit web app for user‑friendly price prediction

Key Techniques Used (Business‑Focused)
Location‑aware pricing logic to capture real geographic price differences
Smart handling of missing data to preserve realistic property characteristics
Model comparison and selection to avoid guess‑based modeling
Optimized model size for faster predictions and smoother deployment

Business Value Delivered
✔ More accurate and consistent property price estimates
✔ Reduced reliance on manual valuation methods
✔ Faster pricing decisions for agents and investors
✔ A scalable foundation that can be integrated into real estate platforms

Use Cases
Real estate agencies
Property investment firms
Online property listing platforms
Market analysis & valuation tools
