# How to Use

## 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

## 2️⃣ Install dependencies

Create a virtual environment and install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Make sure packages like `streamlit`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, etc., are included.

## 3️⃣ Run the main script to generate models

The `price_prediction.py` file performs:

- Data preprocessing and EDA  
- Model training  
- Saving of encoders, scalers, and trained models as `.pkl` files  

Run the script:

```bash
python price_prediction.py
```

> After this, all the saved `.pkl` files required for the Streamlit UI will be generated.

## 4️⃣ Run the Streamlit UI

Once the `.pkl` files are generated, launch the interactive dashboard:

```bash
streamlit run ui_house_price.py
```

The UI allows you to:

- Enter house features manually or use sample input  
- Get predicted house prices instantly  

## 5️⃣ Files in the repository

- `price_prediction.py` — Main script for training models and saving required files  
- `single_input.py` — Module for handling single input predictions  
- `ui_house_price.py` — Streamlit application  
- `sample_data.csv` — Small example dataset to test the workflow  

## 6️⃣ Notes

- Make sure `price_prediction.py` is run **before** running the Streamlit UI.  
- The UI depends on the saved models, encoders, and scalers generated by `price_prediction.py`.
